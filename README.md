This is an app I have built for my family at the cottage in the summer

the funcitons once V1 is complete will include: 
  - Weather Forecasting (using AccuWeather API)
  - Garbage scheduling for when the disposal site is open
  - Chores list with full C.R.U.D functionality
  - Contact list with emergency numbers and nearby cottagers in the case of any accident
